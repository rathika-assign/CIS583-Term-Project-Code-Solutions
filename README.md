Project Overview

Goal: Detect Multi-Weather potholes in roadway images using YOLO-based object detection. The repo provides three Jupyter notebooks covering a baseline model, transfer learning, and a multi-weather dataset workflow.
Platform: Windows with Python and Jupyter Notebooks (tested in VS Code).
Scope: Data preparation, training, evaluation, and visualization for pothole detection.
Repository Contents

baseline_yolo_model.ipynb: Baseline YOLO training and evaluation workflow on a pothole dataset. Includes environment setup, dataset loading, training, inference, and basic metrics/visualizations.
transfer_learning_yolo model.ipynb: Transfer learning flow that fine-tunes a YOLO model on the pothole dataset. Focuses on leveraging pre-trained weights and comparing against baseline results.
multiweather_pothole.ipynb: End-to-end pipeline tailored for a multi-weather pothole dataset (e.g., images from different conditions). Covers data exploration, training runs, and performance analysis across weather subsets.
Kaggle Usage

You can run baseline_yolo_model.ipynb and transfer_learning_yolo model.ipynb on Kaggle Notebooks for GPU-backed training.
Steps:
Upload this repository notebooks to Kaggle or create a new Kaggle Notebook and copy the notebook cells.

In Notebook Settings, enable GPU (e.g., Tesla T4) and Internet.

Add your dataset via Kaggle Datasets or mount it using Kaggle’s /kaggle/input/... path. If using a YOLO YAML, point path to /kaggle/working or the dataset’s input path.

Install dependencies within the first cell:

 !pip install --quiet ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib pandas seaborn tqdm
 # For specific torch builds, Kaggle usually preinstalls GPU-ready torch; verify with:
 import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())
Adjust data paths in the notebook to Kaggle locations, e.g., /kaggle/input/<your-dataset>/train/images.

Save artifacts (weights, predictions) to /kaggle/working so they persist in the session output.

The Kaggle links are already included in the GitHub code/notebooks. You can use those links to open the exact notebooks on Kaggle and run them directly.

Dataset

Name/Type: Pothole object detection dataset; the multiweather_pothole.ipynb indicates multiple weather conditions. Use any YOLO-format dataset (images + labels in TXT with class and bounding boxes) organized by train/val/test.

Structure (example):

datasets/pothole/train/images, datasets/pothole/train/labels
datasets/pothole/val/images, datasets/pothole/val/labels
datasets/pothole/test/images, datasets/pothole/test/labels
Dataset YAML: Provide a YOLO dataset YAML (e.g., pothole.yaml) declaring paths and classes. Example:

 path: datasets/pothole
 train: train/images
 val: val/images
 test: test/images
 names:
 	0: pothole
Environment Setup

Install Python 3.10+ and VS Code; use Jupyter/VS Code notebooks.
Create an environment and install dependencies commonly needed for YOLO workflows:
# From the repo root
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
# Core ML/vision stack
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# YOLO toolkit (Ultralytics). If using GPU, install the matching torch build.
pip install ultralytics
# Utilities
pip install opencv-python matplotlib pandas seaborn tqdm
Notes:

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, install the CUDA-matched PyTorch wheels instead of the CPU ones. See https://pytorch.org for the correct command.
If your notebooks reference other packages, install them similarly in the same environment.
How to Run

Open the notebook in VS Code and select the .venv Python kernel:

baseline_yolo_model.ipynb: Run cells from top to bottom to train/evaluate a baseline YOLO model. Update dataset paths and pothole.yaml as needed.
transfer_learning_yolo model.ipynb: Set weights to a pre-trained YOLO checkpoint (e.g., yolov8n.pt) and run to fine-tune on the pothole dataset. Compare metrics against the baseline.
multiweather_pothole.ipynb: Point to the multi-weather dataset splits; run the exploratory cells and training/evaluation sections. Use per-weather analysis cells to compare performance.
Kaggle (alternative run):

Open the notebook on Kaggle with GPU enabled and run the same training/evaluation cells as above, ensuring dataset paths reference /kaggle/input and outputs go to /kaggle/working.
Typical training snippets used by Ultralytics YOLO look like:

from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # or a custom checkpoint
model.train(data='pothole.yaml', epochs=50, imgsz=640)
results = model.val()
model.predict(source='datasets/pothole/test/images', save=True)
Usage Notes

Ensure your dataset is in YOLO format and paths in the notebooks point to valid locations.
Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, imgsz, lr) for your hardware and dataset size.
The notebooks include visualization cells (plots/predictions). Enable image saving if you want outputs written to disk.
Results & Evaluation

After training, examine metrics such as mAP, precision/recall, and loss curves.
Compare baseline vs. transfer learning runs to justify improvements.
For multi-weather analysis, track per-condition performance to identify robustness.
Troubleshooting

Kernel/package issues: Re-open VS Code, re-select the .venv kernel, and re-run pip install commands.
Path errors: Verify pothole.yaml and folder structure. Use absolute paths on Windows if needed.
GPU not used: Confirm CUDA drivers and that your PyTorch build matches the installed CUDA version.
